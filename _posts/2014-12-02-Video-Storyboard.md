	BOULDER72

	EXT.
	Sounds of thunder and rain

	1 - Exterior shot of the house
	2 - Closeup of the window
	3 - Lightning flashes against the window

	Viewed from the outside of a house, lighting flashes against a window 

	4 - FADE IN

	We hear the sound of local news reporting flash flooding all over Boulder County.

	5 - Buffy is sitting alone in her living room with her cat, cuddled up on the couch.  It is raining very hard outside.  

	6 - Lightning strikes again.  

	7 - Buffy jumps and the cat’s claws dig into her legs.

	8 - The lights goes out and the scene goes dark.  The power has gone out.

	9 - Buffy says something like “Oh no, the power has gone out on the whole block”

	10 - Buffy looks out the window and, in the light from the lightning, sees the water rising on the lawn.  

	11 - She pulls out her phone and launches the Boulder72 app.

	12 - CLOSEUP: Phone

	13 - Buffy clicks on the “Alerts” icon and is brought to the alert page which shows her location on a map with an overlaid evacuation area.  

	14 - Above it she sees a flashing notification: 

	“THERE IS NO EVACUATION ORDER SET FOR YOUR LOCATION. SHELTER IN PLACE AND CONTINUE TO FOLLOW UPDATES FROM LOCAL AUTHORITIES”

	15 - Buffy immediately clicks the preparedness tab of the app to check on her preparedness.

	16, 17 - The app says that she has prepared with all the items recommended by the Boulder Office of Emergency Management, including her documents, food, batteries and warm clothes in a safe place.

	18 - CLOSEUP: Buffy’s face
	She thinks immediately of checking on her friend Dana who has recently moved to the locality and might need help.

	19 - “Dana lives right by the creek.  I’d better make sure she’s ok!”

	20 - CLOSEUP:Phone
	21, 22, 23 - Buffy clicks on the emergency contacts tab of the app,selects Kendra and pings her. The app says that the ping has been sent.

	24, 25 - Something about how Buffy gets a response that Dana is ok, seems content, and relaxes back on her couch with her cat to wait out the storm, safe and sound.
